	abstract = {We revisit the classical dynamic inventory management problem of Scarf (1959b) from the perspective of a decision-maker who has n historical selling seasons of data and must make sensible ordering decisions for the upcoming season. We first prescribe a nonparametric estimation procedure for the (s; S) policy that is asymptotically optimal. We then characterize the finite-sample performance of the estimated (s; S) levels by deriving their asymptotic confidence intervals using the Central Limit Theorem. We further consider having at least some of the past selling seasons of data censored from the absence of backlogging. We show that the intuitive and widely-used procedure of correcting for censoring in the demand data directly yields an inconsistent estimate. We then show how to correctly use the censored data to obtain consistent decisions and derive asymptotic confidence intervals for this policy using Stein’s method to handle the serial correlation that arises due to the correctioning. Surprisingly, censored data can be beneficial under some conditions; that is, estimated decisions with censored data may have smaller variance and mean squared error (MSE) than those with fully uncensored data. We thus arrive at the remarkable result that a decision maker with fully uncensored data can add artificial censored data to optimally estimate the (s; S) policy. We provide a prescription for the optimal level and amount of artificial demand data to add. Our results also apply to the repeated newsvendor problem and the base-stock policy problem by appropriate parameter choices.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a model of conversion behavior (i.e., converting store visits into purchases) that predicts each customer's probability of purchasing based on an observed history of visits and purchases. We offer an individual-level probability model that allows for different forms of customer heterogeneity in a very flexible manner. Specifically, we decompose an individual's conversion behavior into two components: one for accumulating visit effects and another for purchasing threshold effects. Each component is allowed to vary across households as well as over time. Visit effects capture the notion that store visits can play different roles in the purchasing process. For example, some visits are motivated by planned purchases, while others are associated with hedonic browsing (akin to window shopping); our model is able to accommodate these (and several other) types of visit-purchase relationships in a logical, parsimonious manner. The purchasing threshold captures the psychological resistance to online purchasing that may grow or shrink as a customer gains more experience with the purchasing process at a given website. We test different versions of the model that vary in the complexity of these two key components and also compare our general framework with popular alternatives such as logistic regression. We find that the proposed model offers excellent statistical properties, including its performance in a holdout validation sample, and also provides useful managerial diagnostics about the patterns underlying online buyer behavior.},

	abstract = {Retailers that order perishable items are required to make ordering decisions for hundreds of products on a daily basis. This task is non-trivial because the risk of ordering too much or too little is associated with overstocking costs and unsatisfied customers. Traditionally, this problem is solved in a two-step procedure. First, the parameters of a given demand distribution are estimated, and second, an optimization problem based on this distribution is solved to obtain the order quantity. However, in reality, the true demand distribution is almost never known to the decision maker. Therefore, we present a novel solution method based on Artificial Neural Networks and Quantile Regression that does not require the assumption of a specifc demand distribution. We provide an empirical evaluation of our method with point-of-sales data for a large German bakery chain. We find that our method outperforms well-established standard approaches in most cases.},

	abstract = {We consider a seller who can dynamically adjust the price of a product at the individual customer level, by utilizing information about customers’ characteristics encoded as a d-dimensional feature vector. We assume a personalized demand model, parameters of which depend on s out of the d features. The seller initially does not know the relationship between the customer features and the product demand, but learns this through sales observations over a selling horizon of T periods. We prove that the seller’s expected regret, i.e., the revenue loss against a clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand relationship, is at least of order s √T under any admissible policy. We then design a near-optimal pricing policy for a “semi-clairvoyant” seller (who knows which s of the d features are in the demand model) that achieves an expected regret of order s √Tlog T. We extend this policy to a more realistic setting where the seller does not know the true demand predictors, and show this policy has an expected regret of order s √T(log d＋logT), which is also near-optimal. Finally, we test our theory on simulated data and on a data set from an online auto loan company in the United States. On both data sets, our experimentation-based pricing policy is superior to intuitive and/or widely-practiced customized pricing methods such as myopic pricing and segment-then-optimize policies. Furthermore, our policy improves upon the loan company’s historical pricing decisions by 32\% in terms of annual expected revenue.},

"The Relative Likelihood Approach" (Berger 2013:90)
"A difficulty is encountered when the relative likelihood approach is used with unbounded @" (Berger 2013:91)
Essentially, variables such as customer demand in OM problems are always bounded, although technically we assume that it follows a unbounded distribution. This can be used to justify our use of "relative likelihood approach" in constructing the prior. (note on p.91)
 
"Personally, the author prefers the relative likelihood approach, but some may have a better feeling for the histogram approach." (Berger 2013:94)
"One might generalize this (and Example 4) to infinite 0 by giving each 0 equal density, arriving at the uniform 8 E = noninformative prior 7T( 8) c. Although this was routinely done by Laplace (1812), it came under severe (though unjustified) criticism because of a lack of invariance under transformation (see Jaynes (1983) for discussion)." (Berger 2013:96)
"Since the choice of an origin for a unit of measurement is quite arbitrary, the noninformative prior should perhaps be independent of this choice." (Berger 2013:97)
"Perhaps the most embarassing feature of noninformative priors, however, is simply that there are often so many of them." (Berger 2013:102)
"The second response is to argue that, operationally, it is rare for the choice of a noninformative prior to markedly affect the answer (unless the noninformative prior blows up in such a way as to cause the answer to blow up, see Section 4.6), so that any reasonable noninformative prior (even Laplace's constant prior) can be used." (Berger 2013:103)
"Principle of Rational Invariance. The action taken in a decision problem should not depend on the unit of measurement used, or other such arbitrarily chosen incidentals." (Berger 2013:403)},

	abstract = {This paper studies a periodic-review pricing and inventory control problem for a retailer, which faces stochastic price-sensitive demand, under quite general modeling assumptions. Any unsatisfied demand is lost, and any leftover inventory at the end of the finite selling horizon has a salvage value. The cost component for the retailer includes holding, shortage, and both variable and fixed ordering costs. The retailer's objective is to maximize its discounted expected profit over the selling horizon by dynamically deciding on the optimal pricing and replenishment policy for each period. We show that, under a mild assumption on the additive demand function, at the beginning of each period an (s,S) policy is optimal for replenishment, and the value of the optimal price depends on the inventory level after the replenishment decision has been done. Our numerical study also suggests that for a sufficiently long selling horizon, the optimal policy is almost stationary. Furthermore, the fixed ordering cost (K) plays a significant role in our modeling framework. Specifically, any increase in K results in lower s and higher S. On the other hand, the profit impact of dynamically changing the retail price, contrasted with a single fixed price throughout the selling horizon, also increases with K. We demonstrate that using the optimal policy values from a model with backordering of unmet demands as approximations in our model might result in significant profit penalty. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We develop dynamic programming models for these systems in which regular orders as well as emergency orders can be placed periodically. We identify two cases depending on whether or not a fixed cost for placing an emergency order is present. We show that if the emergency supply mode can be used, there exists a critical inventory level such that if the inventory position at a review epoch falls below this critical level, an emergency order is placed. We also develop simple procedures for computing the optimal policy parameters. In all cases, the optimal order-up-to level is obtained by solving a myopic cost function. Thus, the proposed ordering policies are easy to implement.},

	abstract = {To avoid inventory risks, manufacturers often place rush orders with suppliers only after they receive firm orders from their customers (retailers). Rush orders are costly to both parties because the supplier incurs higher production costs. We consider a situation where the supplier's production cost is reduced if the manufacturer can place some of its order in advance. In addition to the rush order contract with a pre-established price, we examine whether the supplier should offer advance-order discounts to encourage the manufacturer to place a portion of its order in advance, even though the manufacturer incurs some inventory risk. While the advance-order discount contract is Pareto-improving, our analysis shows that the discount contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. However, if the supplier imposes a pre-specified minimum order quantity requirement as a qualifier for the manufacturer to receive the advance-order discount, then such a combined contract can coordinate the supply chain. Furthermore, the combined contract enables the supplier to attain the first-best solution. We also explore a delegation contract that either party could propose. Under this contract, the manufacturer delegates the ordering and salvaging activities to the supplier in return for a discounted price on all units procured. We find the delegation contract coordinates the supply chain and is Pareto-improving. We extend our analysis to a setting where the suppliers capacity is limited for advance production but unlimited for rush orders. Our structural results obtained for the one-supplier-one-manufacturer case continue to hold when we have two manufacturers.},

	abstract = {Supply risk is one of the most important enterprise risks. Dual sourcing and backup production are the two operational strategies that firms most commonly use to mitigate supply risk. The base model examines the strategic use of dual sourcing and backup supply options in a two-stage dynamic programming model for one period. In the first stage the firm decides whether to employ single or dual sourcing for primary supply and whether to reserve backup option. In the second stage, if backup option has been reserved, the firm decides the backup production quantity after observing the realized primary delivery. The optimal sourcing strategies are separately characterized under deterministic and uncertain demand. The results show that dual sourcing coexists with backup production when the two primary suppliers have similar and moderate reliabilities and the backup reservation cost is relatively small. When the reliabilities of the two primary suppliers differ significantly, dual sourcing and backup can become mutually exclusive strategies. Furthermore, the existence of the backup production option decreases the probability of selecting dual sourcing; compared with deterministic demand, uncertain demand increases the area of coexistence of dual sourcing and backup production. In particular, when the firm employs dual sourcing, backup production is activated under deterministic demand only when both primary suppliers fail, while can be activated under uncertain demand when one of the primary suppliers fails. We extend the base model to a two-period structure where the reliability of one primary supplier is uncertain, and the firm updates its assessment of supplier reliability based on the delivery in previous period. Based on Bayesian forecast-updating approach, we find that reliability learning weakly increases the area of coexistence of dual sourcing and backup, and weakly decreases the probability of contingent backup production in the coexistence area.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the underlying theory and practice in the use of options in support of emerging business-to-business (B2B) markets. Such options, on both capacity and output, play an important role in integrating long- and short-term contracting between multiple buyers and sellers in such markets. This trend is especially important in capital-intensive industries, where improvements in fine tuning the coordination of supply and demand carry large economic benefits. Typically, such options are benchmarked (or defined) on the basis of spot market information conveyed through near real-time B2B transactions. This paper notes broad set of goods and services currently being traded in both B2B short-run markets and long-term contract markets, and reviews economic and managerial frameworks that have been proposed to explain the structure of contracting in these markets. We provide a general framework based on transactions cost economics, and we use this framework to provide review and synthesis of existing literature to explain various types of contracting linked to B2B exchanges in capital-intensive industries. The paper concludes with a discussion of implementation challenges and open research questions.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the preorder strategy that a seller may use to sell a perishable product in an uncertain market with heterogeneous consumers. By accepting preorders, the seller is able to obtain advance demand information for inventory planning and price discriminate the consumers. Given the preorder option, the consumers react strategically by optimizing the timing of purchase. We find that accurate demand information may improve the availability of the product, which undermines the seller's ability to charge a high preorder price. As a result, advance demand information may hurt the seller's profit due to its negative impact for the preorder season. This cautions the seller about a potential conflict between the benefits of advance demand information and price discrimination when facing strategic consumers. A common practice to contain consumers' strategic waiting is to offer price guarantees that compensate preorder consumers in case of a later price cut. Under price guarantees, the seller will reduce price in the regular season only if the preorder demand is low; however, such advance information implies weak demand in the regular season as well. This means that the seller can no longer benefit from a high demand in the regular season. Therefore, under price guarantees, more accurate advance demand information may still hurt the seller's profit due to its adverse impact for the regular season. We also investigate the seller's strategy choice in such a setting (i.e., whether the preorder option should be offered and whether it should be coupled with price guarantees) and find that the answer depends on the relative sizes of the heterogeneous consumer segments.},

        abstract = {This paper studies a ﬁnite horizon, single product, periodic review inventory system with two supply nodes. Supply nodes are diﬀerentiated by their ﬁxed and variable costs, delivery lead times, as well as constraints on the order sizes. The buyer faces interesting tradeoﬀs: Procuring from one of the supplier, referred to “onshore supplier”, involves a high variable cost but a shorter delivery delay, while procuring from the other supplier, “oﬀshore supplier”, involves a low variable cost but a longer delivery delay. Each order from both suppliers incurs a ﬁxed cost as well as a constraint on the maximum order size. Excess inventories could be salvaged at the end of each period with a ﬁxed cost or be carried over to the next period. We show that the cost-to-go function satisﬁes a certain convexity, called (CK1, K2)convexity introduced in this paper. We also show that the (CK1, K2)-convexity is preserved in certain types of optimizations and derive structural results for solutions of these optimizations involving (CK1, K2)-convex functions. Based on these structural results, we partially characterize the optimal sourcing and salvaging decisions.},

Our approach advocates not to determine the quantity to be sourced a priori. We allow for capacitated sources and any cost structure in which fixed costs and quantity discounts are special cases. Some simpler versions of this problem are shown to be NP-hard in the literature. By proving that the order of the sources is irrelevant for the optimal solution, we devise a dynamic programming model with pseudo-polynomial complexity to solve the multiple supplier sourcing problem to optimality. We propose two extensions: one limits the number of suppliers, and the other allows multi-period sourcing.},

We analyze such contracts in terms of two practical considerations that are relevant in this context but have been overlooked by previous work that has largely studied the direct offer of APD to customers: the retailer's information acquisition cost and the wholesaler's limited information about that cost. The wholesaler's limited knowledge of the retailer's cost leads to a departure—from the normal “full observability” APD design—that is asymmetric and depends on the extent of unobservability; if the uncertainty is small (resp., large) then the optimal discount is higher (resp., lower) than in the case of full observability. An APD contract that ignores the retailer's cost or the wholesaler's uncertainty about it will yield fewer benefits for the wholesaler and the supply chain. We offer a numerical illustration (calibrated on real industry data) establishing that for a representative product, an APD contract can improve the wholesaler's profit margin by as much as 3.5\%.},

	abstract = {B2B spot market has grown rapidly and become an effective trading channel for commodity products. Besides long-term contract procurement from conventional suppliers (forward and option), a buyer can procure or sell commodities at any time in B2B spot market to adjust her inventory level. However, spot prices are generally volatile and the market is imperfect in the sense that spot trading may be realized with uncertainty in a given period of time and often comes with extra transaction cost. This paper considers a commodity buyer who can order forward and option contracts in advance and trade in a B2B spot market when spot price and demand are observed stochastically. Based on a single-period newsvendor model, we discuss three optimal order strategies and derive respective expected profits when the buyer is risk-neutral. The sensitivity of purchase costs, market liquidity and transaction cost is investigated. We also compare the optimal expected profits for different strategies to illustrate the effects of the two long-term contracts in the presence of the B2B spot market. We then extend our model to a multi-period setting and derive the optimal strategy. Finally, we numerically compute the optimal order strategy for a risk-averse buyer and analyze the impact of spot market, risk aversion, as well as the correlation between customer demand and spot price.},

We believe that our field has the expertise and talent to push for advancements in the theory and practice of demand management and manufacturing (of course, among many other areas) along unique dimensions.

	abstract = {The newsvendor problem is one of the most basic and widely applied inventory models. There are numerous extensions of this problem. If the probability distribution of the demand is known, the problem can be solved analytically. However, approximating the probability distribution is not easy and is prone to error; therefore, the resulting solution to the newsvendor problem may be not optimal. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm based on deep learning that optimizes the order quantities for all products based on features of the demand data. Our algorithm integrates the forecasting and inventory-optimization steps, rather than solving them separately, as is typically done, and does not require knowledge of the probability distributions of the demand. Numerical experiments on real-world data suggest that our algorithm outperforms other approaches, including data-driven and machine learning approaches, especially for demands with high volatility. Finally, in order to show how this approach can be used for other inventory optimization problems, we provide an extension for (r, Q) policies.},

	title = {Learning {Enabled} {Optimization}: {Towards} a {Fusion} of {Statistical} {Learning} and {Stochastic} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Several emerging applications, such as “Analytics of Things” and “Integrative Analytics” call for a fusion of statistical learning (SL) and stochastic optimization (SO). The Learning Enabled Optimization paradigm fuses concepts from these disciplines in a manner which not only enriches both SL and SO, but also provides a framework which supports rapid model updates and optimization, together with a methodology for rapid model-validation, assessment, and selection. Moreover, in many big data/big decisions applications these steps are repetitive, and possible only through a continuous cycle involving data analysis, optimization, and validation. This paper sets forth the foundation for such a framework by introducing several novel concepts such as statistical optimality, hypothesis tests for model-ﬁdelity, generalization error of stochastic optimization, and ﬁnally, a non-parametric methodology for model selection. These new concepts provide a formal framework for modeling, solving, validating, and reporting solutions for Learning Enabled Optimization (LEO). We illustrate the LEO framework by applying it to an inventory control model in which we use demand data available for ARIMA modeling in the statistical package “R”. In addition, we also study a production-marketing coordination model based on combining a pedagogical production planning model with an advertising data set intended for sales prediction. Because the approach requires the solution of several stochastic programming instances, some using continuous random variables, we leverage stochastic decomposition (SD) for the fusion of regression and stochastic linear programming. In this sense, the novelty of this paper is its framework, rather than a speciﬁc new algorithm. Finally, we present an architecture of a software framework to bring about the fusion we envision.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and operations research and management science (OR/MS) in developing a framework, along with specific methods, for using data to prescribe optimal decisions in OR/MS problems. In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization and reflecting our practical experience with the data available in applications of OR/MS, we consider data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate that our proposed solution methods, which are inspired by ML methods such as local regression, CART, and random forests, are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems. We prove that they are tractable and asymptotically optimal even when data is not iid and may be censored. We extend this to the case where decision variables may directly affect uncertainty in unknown ways, such as pricing's effect on demand. As an analogue to R{\textasciicircum}2, we develop a metric P termed the coefficient of prescriptiveness to measure the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from an operations perspective. To demonstrate the power of our approach in a real-world setting we study an inventory management problem faced by the distribution arm of an international media conglomerate, which ships an average of 1bil units per year. We leverage internal data and public online data harvested from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to prescribe operational decisions that outperform baseline measures. Specifically, the data we collect, leveraged by our methods, accounts for an 88{\textbackslash}\% improvement as measured by our P.},

We demonstrate the application of our method to customized pricing and personalized assortment optimization. We show that learning under our model takes place reliably by establishing finite- sample convergence guarantees for model parameters which hold regardless of the number of customer types, which can be potentially uncountable. The parameter convergence guarantees are then extended to performance guarantees in decision problems. In particular, we provide high-probability bound on the gap between the expected revenue of the best action taken under the estimated parameters and the revenue generated by a decision-maker with full knowledge of the demand distribution. We conduct simulated experiments to demonstrate the performance of our method. We further test our method on real transaction data for airline seating reservations and show that effective customized pricing can increase revenue by at least 7\% over the best single-price.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a model of conversion behavior (i.e., converting store visits into purchases) that predicts each customer's probability of purchasing based on an observed history of visits and purchases. We offer an individual-level probability model that allows for different forms of customer heterogeneity in a very flexible manner. Specifically, we decompose an individual's conversion behavior into two components: one for accumulating visit effects and another for purchasing threshold effects. Each component is allowed to vary across households as well as over time. Visit effects capture the notion that store visits can play different roles in the purchasing process. For example, some visits are motivated by planned purchases, while others are associated with hedonic browsing (akin to window shopping); our model is able to accommodate these (and several other) types of visit-purchase relationships in a logical, parsimonious manner. The purchasing threshold captures the psychological resistance to online purchasing that may grow or shrink as a customer gains more experience with the purchasing process at a given website. We test different versions of the model that vary in the complexity of these two key components and also compare our general framework with popular alternatives such as logistic regression. We find that the proposed model offers excellent statistical properties, including its performance in a holdout validation sample, and also provides useful managerial diagnostics about the patterns underlying online buyer behavior.},

In particular, we consider the case in which the distribution of the input is unknown, yet there is some historical data drawn from the distribution. In this paper, we propose a new type of distributionally robust optimization model called the likelihood robust optimization (LRO) model for this class of problems. In contrast to previous work on distributionally robust optimization that focuses on certain parameters (e.g., mean, variance, etc.) of the input distribution, we exploit the historical data and define the accessible distribution set to contain only those distributions that make the observed data achieve a certain level of likelihood. Then we formulate the targeting problem as one of optimizing the expected value of the objective function under the worst-case distribution in that set. Our model avoids the over-conservativeness of some prior robust approaches by ruling out unrealistic distributions while maintaining robustness of the solution for any statistically likely outcomes. We present statistical analyses of our model using Bayesian statistics and empirical likelihood theory. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic behavior of our distribution set and establish the relationship between our model and other distributionally robust models. To test the performance of our model, we apply it to the newsvendor problem and the portfolio selection problem. The test results show that the solutions of our model indeed have desirable performance.},

We demonstrate how this result affects the feasibility of Mitchell's version of space approach and how it shows that it is unlikely that this class of concepts is polynomially learnable from random examples alone in the PAC framework of Valiant. On the other hand, we show that for any fixed bound on the number of objects per scene, this class is polynomially learnable if, in addition to providing random examples, we allow the learning algorithm to make subset queries. In establishing this result, we calculate the capacity of the hypothesis space of conjunctive concepts in a structural domain and use a general theorem of Vapnik and Chervonenkis. This latter result can also be used to estimate a sample size sufficient for heuristic learning techniques that do not use queries.},

	abstract = {We consider packing linear programs with m rows where all constraint coefficients are normalized to be in the unit interval. The n columns arrive in random order and the goal is to set the corresponding decision variables irrevocably when they arrive to obtain a feasible solution maximizing the expected reward. Previous (1 − ϵ)-competitive algorithms require the right-hand side of the linear program to be Ω((m/ϵ2)log(n/ϵ)), a bound that worsens with the number of columns and rows. However, the dependence on the number of columns is not required in the single-row case, and known lower bounds for the general case are also independent of n. Our goal is to understand whether the dependence on n is required in the multirow case, making it fundamentally harder than the single-row version. We refute this by exhibiting an algorithm that is (1 − ϵ)-competitive as long as the right-hand sides are Ω((m2/ϵ2)log(m/ϵ)). Our techniques refine previous probably approximately correct learning based approaches that interpret the online decisions as linear classifications of the columns based on sampled dual prices. The key ingredient of our improvement comes from a nonstandard covering argument together with the realization that only when the columns of the linear program belong to few one-dimensional subspaces we can obtain such small covers; bounding the size of the cover constructed also relies on the geometry of linear classifiers. General packing linear programs are handled by perturbing the input columns, which can be seen as making the learning problem more robust.},

	abstract = {"Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering"--},

The first step follows machine learning theory paradigm and consists in determining a set of possible predictors as randomized estimators in (possibly numerous) different predictive models. The second step follows the model selection paradigm and consists in choosing one predictor with good properties among all the predictors of the first steps. We study our procedure for two different types of bservations: causal Bernoulli shifts and bounded weakly dependent processes. In both cases, we give oracle inequalities: the risk of the chosen predictor is close to the best prediction risk in all predictive models that we consider. We apply our procedure for predictive models such as linear predictors, neural networks predictors and non-parametric autoregressive.},

	abstract = {In computational learning theory, probably approximately correct learning (PAC learning) is a framework for mathematical analysis of machine learning. It was proposed in 1984 by Leslie Valiant.
In this framework, the learner receives samples and must select a generalization function (called the hypothesis) from a certain class of possible functions. The goal is that, with high probability (the "probably" part), the selected function will have low generalization error (the "approximately correct" part). The learner must be able to learn the concept given any arbitrary approximation ratio, probability of success, or distribution of the samples.
The model was later extended to treat noise (misclassified samples).
An important innovation of the PAC framework is the introduction of computational complexity theory concepts to machine learning. In particular, the learner is expected to find efficient functions (time and space requirements bounded to a polynomial of the example size), and the learner itself must implement an efficient procedure (requiring an example count bounded to a polynomial of the concept size, modified by the approximation and likelihood bounds).},

This paper introduces a new framework for theoretically measuring the performance of such algorithms called Uniform-PAC, which is a strengthening of the classical Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. In contrast to the PAC framework, the uniform version may be used to derive high probability regret guarantees and so forms a bridge between the two setups that has been missing in the literature. We demonstrate the benefits of the new framework for finite-state episodic MDPs with a new algorithm that is Uniform-PAC and simultaneously achieves optimal regret and PAC guarantees except for a factor of the horizon.},

	title = {Sample {Complexity} {Bounds} on {Differentially} {Private} {Learning} via {Communication} {Complexity}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6278},
	abstract = {In this work we analyze the sample complexity of classification by differentially private algorithms. Differential privacy is a strong and well-studied notion of privacy introduced by Dwork et al. (2006) that ensures that the output of an algorithm leaks little information about the data point provided by any of the participating individuals. Sample complexity of private PAC and agnostic learning was studied in a number of prior works starting with (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) but a number of basic questions still remain open, most notably whether learning with privacy requires more samples than learning without privacy. We show that the sample complexity of learning with (pure) differential privacy can be arbitrarily higher than the sample complexity of learning without the privacy constraint or the sample complexity of learning with approximate differential privacy. Our second contribution and the main tool is an equivalence between the sample complexity of (pure) differentially private learning of a concept class \$C\$ (or \$SCDP(C)\$) and the randomized one-way communication complexity of the evaluation problem for concepts from \$C\$. Using this equivalence we prove the following bounds: 1. \$SCDP(C) = {\textbackslash}Omega(LDim(C))\$, where \$LDim(C)\$ is the Littlestone's (1987) dimension characterizing the number of mistakes in the online-mistake-bound learning model. Known bounds on \$LDim(C)\$ then imply that \$SCDP(C)\$ can be much higher than the VC-dimension of \$C\$. 2. For any \$t\$, there exists a class \$C\$ such that \$LDim(C)=2\$ but \$SCDP(C) {\textbackslash}geq t\$. 3. For any \$t\$, there exists a class \$C\$ such that the sample complexity of (pure) \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-differentially private PAC learning is \${\textbackslash}Omega(t/{\textbackslash}alpha)\$ but the sample complexity of the relaxed \$({\textbackslash}alpha,{\textbackslash}beta)\$-differentially private PAC learning is \$O({\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}beta)/{\textbackslash}alpha)\$. This resolves an open problem of Beimel et al. (2013b).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5164},
	abstract = {We study several questions in the reliable agnostic learning framework of Kalai et al. (2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of error is costlier than others. A positive reliable classifier is one that makes no false positive errors. The goal in the positive reliable agnostic framework is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ more than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class. A closely related notion is fully reliable agnostic learning, which considers partial classifiers that are allowed to predict "unknown" on some inputs. The best fully reliable partial classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting "unknown", and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a hypothesis that is almost as good as the best fully reliable partial classifier from a class. For distribution-independent learning, the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial approximations. We show that one-sided polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations. Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning. Our algorithms also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time.},

	title = {Characterizing the {Sample} {Complexity} of {Private} {Learners}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2224},
	abstract = {In 2008, Kasiviswanathan et al. defined private learning as a combination of PAC learning and differential privacy. Informally, a private learner is applied to a collection of labeled individual information and outputs a hypothesis while preserving the privacy of each individual. Kasiviswanathan et al. gave a generic construction of private learners for (finite) concept classes, with sample complexity logarithmic in the size of the concept class. This sample complexity is higher than what is needed for non-private learners, hence leaving open the possibility that the sample complexity of private learning may be sometimes significantly higher than that of non-private learning. We give a combinatorial characterization of the sample size sufficient and necessary to privately learn a class of concepts. This characterization is analogous to the well known characterization of the sample complexity of non-private learning in terms of the VC dimension of the concept class. We introduce the notion of probabilistic representation of a concept class, and our new complexity measure RepDim corresponds to the size of the smallest probabilistic representation of the concept class. We show that any private learning algorithm for a concept class C with sample complexity m implies RepDim(C)=O(m), and that there exists a private learning algorithm with sample complexity m=O(RepDim(C)). We further demonstrate that a similar characterization holds for the database size needed for privately computing a large class of optimization problems and also for the well studied problem of private data release.},

	title = {More data speeds up training time in learning halfspaces over sparse vectors},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2271},
	abstract = {The increased availability of data in recent years has led several authors to ask whether it is possible to use data as a \{{\textbackslash}em computational\} resource. That is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required to perform the learning task? We give the first positive answer to this question for a \{{\textbackslash}em natural supervised learning problem\} --- we consider agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over \$3\$-sparse vectors in \${\textbackslash}\{-1,1,0{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}n\$. This class is inefficiently learnable using \$O{\textbackslash}left(n/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}right)\$ examples. Our main contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establishing computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely believed assumption that refuting random \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{3CNF\}\$ formulas is hard, it is impossible to efficiently learn this class using only \$O{\textbackslash}left(n/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}right)\$ examples. We further show that under stronger hardness assumptions, even \$O{\textbackslash}left(n{\textasciicircum}\{1.499\}/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}right)\$ examples do not suffice. On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class efficiently using \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}{\textbackslash}left(n{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}right)\$ examples. This formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem.},

	abstract = {We are living in an era in which data is generated in huge volume with high velocity and variety. Big Data and technology are reshaping our life and business. Our research inevitably needs to catch up with these changes. In this short essay, we focus on two aspects of supply chain management, namely, demand management and manufacturing. We feel that, while rapidly growing research on these two areas is contributed by scholars in computer science and engineering, the developments made by production and operations management society have been insufficient. We believe that our field has the expertise and talent to push for advancements in the theory and practice of demand management and manufacturing (of course, among many other areas) along unique dimensions. We summarize some relevant concepts emerged with Big Data and present several prototype models to demonstrate how these concepts can lead to rethinking of our research. Our intention is to generate interests and guide directions for new research in production and operations management in the era of Big Data.},

"distributions. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that typically, samples of past demand data are quite small. Hence, the high variance of the parameter estimates often results in inventory policies of very poor quality. Thus, it would be highly desirable to have adaptive inventory policies, whose regret relative to optimal policies based on full knowledge of the demand distribution is small, and which tend to the same optimal policies as the demand data increase. Traditionally, firms use probabilistic distributions to model stochastic demand. Parameters of such distributions are estimated using past demand data, often with additional assumptions such as independence and stationarity. The estimated parameters are then used to compute optimal inventory policies. Clearly, the success of such inventory policies is very sensitive to the choice of probability" (Ramamurthy, George Shanthikumar and Shen 2012:291)

"Hayes (1969) defined and illustrated the use of the concept of "Expected Total Operating Cost" (ETOC) in dealing with inventory policy estimation when the cost structure was piecewise linear. He showed through examples that estimates based on classical procedures were often unsatisfactory when viewed in terms of ETOC, and derived improved estimates. Then, he considered the problem from a Bayesian point of view, and derived the prior distributions (within a particular class) that were implied by the adoption of the aforementioned superior procedures."

	abstract = {We consider optimal decision-making problems in an uncertain environment. In particular, we consider the case in which the distribution of the input is unknown, yet there is abundant historical data drawn from the distribution. In this paper, we propose a new type of distributionally robust optimization model called the likelihood robust optimization (LRO) model for this class of problems. In contrast to previous work on distributionally robust optimization that focuses on certain parameters (e.g., mean, variance, etc.) of the input distribution, we exploit the historical data and define the accessible distribution set to contain only those distributions that make the observed data achieve a certain level of likelihood. Then we formulate the targeting problem as one of optimizing the expected value of the objective function under the worst-case distribution in that set. Our model avoids the over-conservativeness of some prior robust approaches by ruling out unrealistic distributions while maintaining robustness of the solution for any statistically likely outcomes. We present statistical analyses of our model using Bayesian statistics and empirical likelihood theory. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic behavior of our distribution set and establish the relationship between our model and other distributionally robust models. To test the performance of our model, we apply it to the newsvendor problem and the portfolio selection problem. The test results show that the solutions of our model indeed have desirable performance.},

	abstract = {We investigate the data-driven newsvendor problem when one has n observations of p features related to the demand as well as historical demand data. Rather than a two-step process of first estimating a demand distribution then optimizing for the optimal order quantity, we propose solving the "Big Data" newsvendor problem via single step machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose algorithms based on the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle, with and without regularization, and an algorithm based on Kernel-weights Optimization (KO). The ERM approaches, equivalent to high-dimensional quantile regression, can be solved by convex optimization problems and the KO approach by a sorting algorithm. We analytically justify the use of features by showing that their omission yields inconsistent decisions. We then derive finite-sample performance bounds on the out-of-sample costs of the feature-based algorithms, which quantify the effects of dimensionality and cost parameters. Our bounds, based on algorithmic stability theory, generalize known analyses for the newsvendor problem without feature information. Finally, we apply the feature-based algorithms for nurse staffing in a hospital emergency room using a data set from a large UK teaching hospital and find that (i) the best ERM and KO algorithms beat the best practice benchmark by 23\% and 24\% respectively in the out-of-sample cost, and (ii) the best KO algorithm is faster than the best ERM algorithm by three orders of magnitude and the best practice benchmark by two orders of magnitude.},

As each consumer privately observes an initial estimate prior to the transactions and an updated information postpurchase, the problem exhibits the sequential screening feature and return policy emerges as part of the optimal selling scheme. We show that the optimal selling scheme nicely resembles the classical multiunit auction design, and the product is returned too often compared to the efficient scenario. Furthermore, even though the postpurchase information update is privately observed by the individual consumers, the seller does not give away additional surplus to the consumers. Our general framework can accommodate various heterogeneities and uncertainties regarding hassle costs, shipping costs, salvage values, and reservation values. Our results go through even if the seller cannot commit to the refund amounts, the seller has flexible capacity, or consumers have multiunit demands.},

In particular, many eCRM problems have been traditionally addressed using DM methods. There are opportunities for optimization to improve these methods, and this paper describes these opportunities. Further, an online appendix (mansci.pubs.informs.org/ecompanion.html) describes how DM methods can help optimization-based approaches.

We analyze the cost economics of two suppliers in a broader inventory-logistics framework, one that includes in-transit inventories and transportation costs. In this broader perspective, we provide a simple heuristic and sample exchange curves to determine: (i) if the order should be split between the suppliers; and (ii) if the order is split, the amount of discount and the fraction ordered to the secondary supplier to make order-splitting a worth-while policy. ©},

In addition to employing a faster delivery mode, QR can be achieved by local sourcing (instead of offshore sourcing). This paper analytically studies how a properly designed carbon footprint taxation scheme can be imposed on a QR system to enhance environmental sustainability via employing a local manufacturer by offsetting the probable higher total logistics and production costs. By examining both the single-ordering and the dual-ordering QR systems, we illustrate how the carbon footprint taxation scheme affects the optimal choice of sourcing decision. Our analytical findings reveal that a properly designed carbon footprint taxation scheme by governing body not only can successfully entice the fashion retailer to source from a local manufacturer, but it can also lead to a lower level of risk for the fashion retailer. A mean-risk improving scenario hence results and it provides a significant incentive to convince the fashion retailer to support the idea of joining QR when the carbon footprint tax is in place.},

Both the supplier and the retailer have the classical non-linear economic ordering cost functions consisting of ordering and holding costs. We assume that the retailer has the market power to enforce any order quantity. Furthermore, the retailer has private holding costs. The supplier wants to minimise his expected costs by offering a menu of contracts with side payments as an incentive mechanism. We consider a general number of discrete single-dimensional retailer types with type-dependent default options. A natural and common model formulation is non-convex, but we present an equivalent convex formulation. Hence, the contracting model can be solved efficiently for a general number of retailer types. We also derive structural properties of the optimal menu of contracts. In particular, we completely characterise the optimum for two retailer types and provide a minimal list of candidate contracts for three types. We show that the retailer’s lying behaviour is more complex than simply lying to have higher costs. Finally, we prove a sufficient condition to guarantee unique contracts in the optimal solution for a general number of retailer types.},

As the local supplier needs to put in additional effort to fulfill the urgent orders, it is difficult for the manufacturer to estimate this urgent supplier’s production cost. This asymmetric cost information becomes an obstacle for the manufacturer in managing the urgent supplier. In this paper, we study two types of contingent contracts. One is the common price-only contract, and the other is a contract menu consisting of a transfer payment and a lead time quotation. We construct a Stackelberg game model and evaluate how the involvement of an urgent supplier with private cost information affects performances of the prime supplier and the manufacturer in different scenarios (with or without the urgent supplier, under different contingent contracts). We also conduct numerical experiments to show how the parameters of the contracts affect profits of the manufacturer.},

Interestingly, using a very general model we find that the manufacturer’s decision can be independent of both the number of available suppliers and of the mechanism it uses to update its beliefs after an audit. We illustrate our general model by considering a possible application, where a manufacturer is making the outsource-audit decisions when the suppliers are more cost effective.

We show that the manufacturer’s incentive to share his improved demand information depends on the supply contract signed with the retailer. Furthermore, mandating the manufacturer to disclose his improved demand information can actually reduce the total channel profit. We provide managerial insights by analyzing three widely used contract forms. We investigate whether these contracts are robust under an unanticipated demand information update observed by the manufacturer. We show that the quantity flexibility contract with a high return rate is not robust. The buyback contract, however, is robust and always achieves information sharing while preserving channel performance.},

	abstract = {This paper considers coordinated decisions in a decentralized supply chain consisting of a vendor and a buyer with controllable lead time. We analyze two supply chain inventory models. In the first model we assume the vendor has complete information about the buyer’s cost structure. By taking both the vendor and the buyer’s individual rationalities into consideration, a side payment coordination mechanism is designed to realize supply chain Pareto dominance. In the second model we consider a setting where the buyer possesses private cost information. We design the coordination mechanism by using principal–agent model to induce the buyer to report his true cost structure. The solution procedures are also developed to get the optimal solutions of these two models. The results of numerical examples show that shortening lead time to certain extent can reduce inventory cost and the coordination mechanisms designed for both symmetric and asymmetric information situations are effective.},

	abstract = {Inventory sharing among decentralized retailers has been widely used in practice to improve profitability and reduce risks at the same time. We study the coordination of a decentralized inventory sharing system with n (n {\textgreater} 2) retailers who non-cooperatively determine their order quantities but cooperatively share their inventory. There has been very limited research on coordinating such a system due to the many unique challenges involved, e.g., incomplete residual sharing, formation of subcoalitions for inventory sharing etc. In this paper, we develop a coordination mechanism (nRCM) that simultaneously possesses a few important properties—leading to formation of only grand coalition, inducing complete residual sharing, and ensuring each retailer obtains a higher profit as the system size increases. We also consider the impact of asymmetric demand distribution parameter information on the coordination mechanisms when the retailers privately hold such information. We show that although true coordination requires complete information sharing, under any n-retailer inventory sharing coordination mechanism, retailers may not have incentives to share information with all other retailers and will not share true information even if they do so. In this regard, nRCM possesses another important property: it can be implemented under asymmetric information and retailers can obtain profits very close to their first-best profits even if they do not share demand information. Such nice properties of nRCM also hold when retailers have correlated demands. This paper is the first to study coordination mechanism for an n-retailer (n {\textgreater} 2) inventory sharing system considering asymmetric information.},

	abstract = {Given a quantity discount contract, retailers often prefer group buying to individual purchasing to acquire a lower wholesale price. However, under the combined effects of asymmetric demand information and different moving sequences, information revelation/acquisition between retailers may occur under group buying, thereby directly affecting their preference between individual purchasing and group buying. To capture their real preferences, we develop a model in which two retailers with asymmetric demand information purchase products from a common supplier under either individual purchasing or group buying (when moving first, later or simultaneously) and then sell to the market. We show that the informed retailer may forego group buying due to her loss of information advantage because her order quantity is revealed by the uninformed retailer. Moreover, the uninformed retailer may also reject group buying, despite obtaining demand information, because acquiring information by purposely moving later eliminates the uninformed retailer’s first-mover right and reduces his market share. Furthermore, in the context of information management, we demonstrate that the process of information revelation/acquisition harms the informed retailer to some extent but benefits the uninformed retailer to a greater extent relative to the first-best outcome under perfect information. We also address that the first-mover right becomes less valuable for both retailers with increased information value and, in particular, that their preferences concerning the moving sequence cannot reach a consensus in any case.},

We investigate two collaboration mechanisms: ‘Too Little’ and ‘Too Late’, depending on the timing of information sharing between the manufacturer and the retailer. Our research results indicate that early collaboration as in the ‘Too Little’ mechanism leads to a stable production schedule, which decreases the need of production adjustment when production cost information becomes available; whereas a late collaboration as in the ‘Too Late’ mechanism enhances the flexibility of production adjustment when demand information warrants it. In addition, the asymmetric demand information confounds production decisions all the time; the manufacturer has to provide proper incentives to ensure truthful information sharing in collaboration. Information asymmetry might also reduce the difference in production decision between the ‘Too Little’ and ‘Too Late’ collaboration mechanisms. Numerical analysis is further conducted to demonstrate the performance implications of the collaboration mechanisms on the supply chain.},

	abstract = {In the producer–seller relationship, the seller, besides his role of selling, is often in an ideal position to gather useful market information for the producer’s operations planning. Incentive alignment is critical to motivate both information-acquisition and sales efforts. Two popular contract forms are investigated. One is the forecast-based contract (FC) that requires the seller to submit a demand forecast: the seller obtains commissions from the realized sales but is also obliged to pay a penalty for any deviation of the sales from the forecast. The other is the classical menu of linear contracts (MLC), from which the seller can choose a contract that specifies a unique commission rate and a fixed payment. The conventional understanding suggests that the MLC is superior, but it is often assumed that information is exogenously endowed. In contrast, we find that, with an endogenous information-acquisition effort, the MLC may suffer from a conflicted moral hazard effect that creates friction between motivations for the two efforts. The FC can, however, decouple these two tasks and thus dominate the MLC. We further find that when ensuring interim participation is necessary (e.g., renegotiation cannot be prevented after information acquisition), the performance of the FC might be affected by the adverse selection effect because it is unable to effectively separate different types, at which the MLC excels. We show that when the demand and supply mismatch cost is substantial, the conflicted moral hazard effect dominates the adverse selection effect, and the FC is more efficient, and it is the converse otherwise. These findings can enrich the understanding of these two contract forms and are useful for sales and operations planning. This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine a supply chain in which a single supplier sells to a downstream retailer. We consider a multiperiod model with the following sequence of events. In period t the supplier offers a contract to the retailer, and the retailer makes her purchasing decision in anticipation of the random demand. The demand then unravels, and the retailer carries over any excess inventory to the next period (unmet demand is lost). In period t+1 the supplier designs a new contract based on his belief of the retailer's inventory, and the game is played dynamically. We assume that short-term contracts are used, i.e., the contracting is dynamically conducted at the beginning of each period. We also assume that the retailer's inventory before ordering is not observed by the supplier. This setting describes scenarios in which the downstream retailer does not share inventory/sales information with the supplier. For instance, it captures the phenomenon of retailers distorting past sales information to secure better contracting terms from their suppliers. We cast our problem as a dynamic adverse-selection problem and show that, given relatively high production and holding costs, the optimal contract can take the form of a batch-order contract, which minimizes the retailer's information advantage. We then analyze the performance of this type of contract with respect to some useful benchmarks and quantify the value of prudent contract design and the value of inventory information to the supply chain. Markovian adverse-selection models, in which the state and action in a period affect the state in the subsequent period, are recognized as theoretically challenging and are relatively less understood. We take a nontrivial step towards a better understanding of such models under short-term contracting.},

	abstract = {This paper studies a global sourcing problem where a buyer sources a product from a supplier to satisfy uncertain market demand. With the increasing length and complexity of today’s global supply chains, the buyer may face two issues when designing the sourcing contract: adverse selection (i.e., the supplier’s cost structure is private information) and noncontractible capacity (i.e., the supplier’s capacity investment is not contractible). We show that noncontractible capacity does not necessarily lead to a lower profit for the buyer, but it may require a more complex contract format to achieve the optimal (second-best) profit. Interestingly, we find that a single, linear contract (or a two-part tariff) could be optimal for the buyer under certain conditions. Even when such a contract is suboptimal, it can deliver close-to-optimal profit for the buyer for a wide range of situations. These findings indicate that the value of using a complex menu of contracts is negligible in such a supply chain setting. A simple two-part tariff is an attractive option for buyers whose goal is to ensure supply while facing both cost uncertainty and contractibility issues. The paper also provides a new explanation for the prevalence of such simple contracts in practice. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0628.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the role of time in forecast information sharing and decision making under uncertainty. To do so, we provide a general framework to model the evolutions of forecasts generated by multiple decision makers who forecast demand for the same product. We also model the evolutions of forecasts when decision makers have asymmetric demand information and refer to it as the Martingale Model of Asymmetric Forecast Evolutions. This model helps us study mechanism design problems in a dynamic environment. In particular, we consider a supplier's (principal's) problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a manufacturer (agent) when both firms obtain asymmetric demand information for the end product over multiple periods. The supplier uses demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision. When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay, however, may increase (respectively, decrease) the degree of information asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher (respectively, lower) cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. Considering all such trade-offs, the supplier has to determine (i) when to stop obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast information or to determine the capacity level without information sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism. This paper provides an answer to these questions. In doing so, we develop a new solution approach for a class of dynamic mechanism design problems. In addition, this paper provides a framework to quantify the option value of time for a strategic investment decision under the dynamic evolutions of asymmetric forecasts.

The supplier incurs prevention costs to reduce the probability of selling a defective product, and the buyer incurs appraisal costs to identify defects. Both decisions are subject to moral hazard. We show that the first-best outcome can be obtained if either: (i) the supplier's prevention decision is contractible; or (ii) the buyer's appraisal decision and either internal failure (i.e., the product's failing the buyer's appraisal test) or external failure (i.e., the product's failing after being sold by the buyer) are contractible events; or (iii) both internal and external failure are contractible events. We then focus on the second-best setting where actions and failures are not contractible and study the effect of making the buyer's appraisal result contractible. Relative to first-best, if a buyer's return decision is contractible (but not his appraisal result), the supplier incurs lower prevention costs, the buyer incurs higher appraisal costs, expected internal failure costs are higher, and the total cost of quality is higher. The expected costs of external failure, however, may actually be lower relative to first-best. We then show that installing an information system that makes the appraisal result contractible reduces the inefficiency associated with the seller's prevention activity, increases the inefficiency associated with the buyer's quality appraisal activity, and unambiguously improves product quality.},

	abstract = {Based on a supply chain framework, we study the stocking decision of a downstream buyer who receives private demand information and has the incentive to influence her capital market valuation. We first characterize a market equilibrium under a general, single buyback contract. We show that the buyer's stocking decision can be distorted in equilibrium. Such a downstream stocking distortion hurts the buyer firm's own performance, and it also influences the performances of the supplier and the supply chain. We further reveal scenarios where full supply chain efficiency cannot be reached under any single buyback contract. Then, focusing on contract design, we characterize conditions under which a menu of buyback contracts can prevent downstream stocking distortion and restore full efficiency in the supply chain. Our study demonstrates that in a supply chain context, a firm's incentive to undertake real economic activities to influence capital market valuation can potentially be resolved through operational means.

	abstract = {We analyze a finite horizon periodic-review inventory model in the presence of advance purchase discount (APD). In addition to the opportunity to place a contingent order when required, the buyer can also commit to advance orders and receive discounts. Thus the buyer faces the following tradeoff: Contingent orders provide operational flexibility to respond to uncertain demands at a high purchase cost, whereas advance orders incur low purchase cost while sacrificing operational flexibility. We consider a simple and easy-to-implement APD scheme in which the buyer enjoys price discounts by committing at the outset to a fixed size of advanced order for each period along with contingent orders when required. We first show that for any given advance order size, an advance-order dependent (s, S) policy is optimal. We then find the advance order size together with the corresponding (s, S) policy that minimizes the buyer’s total cost.},

	abstract = {The classical proofs for the existence of a stationary (s, S) inventory policy that minimizes the total discounted or average cost over an infinite horizon are lengthy because they depend heavily on the optimality results for corresponding finite-horizon models. This note presents a simpler alternative. Since optimal stationary (s, S) policies are relatively simple to characterize, it is easy to construct a solution to the optimality equation which is satisfied by an (s, S) policy or an equivalent variant thereof. For the discounted model, the proof characterizes an (s, S) policy that is optimal for all initial inventory positions. This policy can be generated by a simple existing algorithm. For the average-cost model, the optimality proof is completed with some additional arguments, which are simple but novel, to overcome the normal difficulties encountered in models with unbounded one-step expected costs.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with a generalization of classical inventory models (with fixed ordering costs) that exhibit (s, S) policies. In our model, the distribution of demands in successive periods is dependent on a Markov chain. The model includes the case of cyclic or seasonal demand. The model is further extended to incorporate some other realistic features such as no ordering periods and storage and service level constraints. Both finite and infinite horizon nonstationary problems are considered. We show that (s, S) policies are also optimal for the generalized model as well as its extensions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we use a Markov decision process (MDP) to model the joint inventory-promotion decision problem. The state variable of the MDP represents the demand state brought about by changing environmental factors as well as promotion decisions. The demand state in a period determines the distribution of the random demand in that period. Optimal inventory and promotion decision policies in the finite horizon problem are obtained via dynamic programming. Under certain conditions, we show that there is a threshold inventory level P for each demand state such that if the threshold is exceeded, then it is desirable to promote the product. For the proportional ordering cost case, the optimal inventory replenishment policy is a base-stock type policy with the optimal base-stock level dependent on the promotion decision.(Inventory Model; Markov Decision Process; Marketing; Promotion; Dynamic Programming; Finite Horizon; Base-Stock Policy; Threshold Policy)},
